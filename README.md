Interoperability technology is important in healthcare industries because it enables the seamless exchange and integration of healthcare data between different systems, applications, and organizations.  Healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders can securely access, share, and use health information regardless of the source or technology platform.  Standards and protocols used in interoperability technology include HL7, FHIR, CDAs and CCDAs, and ICD Codes.  Data is exchanged using many different methods including point to point interfaces, HIEs, and APIs, ensuring that data flows securely and efficiently between different systems such as EHRs, LISs, and radiology systems.  To achieve semantic interoperability standardized terminologies such as SNOMED-CT and LOINC are used to facilitate accurate data exchange and interpretation.  Based on the complexity and depth of the data exchange there are many levels of interoperability which include foundational, structural, and semantic.  One of the most important aspects of interoperability is that of Health Information Exchange, which allows for the secure exchange of patient data across different healthcare organizations, systems, and regions.  TEFCA or Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement, an initiative of the ONC of HIT in the US, establishes a common set of principles, terms and conditions for the nationwide exchange of EHI.  QHINs or Qualified Health information Networks are entities designated by the ONC under TEFCA that facilitate exchange of health information and act as intermediaries to connect and coordinate information flow ensuring secure transmission and appropriate access by authorized entities.  
	FHIR or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, a standard developed by HL7 to facilitate interoperability in healthcare, uses modern web technologies such as RESTful APIs, that allow for the exchange of healthcare data in a fast and efficient manner.  This standard is often simulated in Sandbox Environments that leverage FHIR specifications that allow for mock scenario testing, application development and innovation.  Benefits of using FHIR Sandbox environments include prototyping and testing, education and training, standard compliance, and collaboration and innovation.  They provide a valuable platform for experimenting, learning, and advancing the adoption of FHIR based interoperability solutions in healthcare.  
	Besides the FHIR standard and HIE, there are many trends in interoperability technology related to healthcare.  Patient access to APIs is an important one because it empowers patients with their health information.  The 21st Century Cures Act is instrumental in this empowerment in that it requires healthcare organizations to provide patients with access to electronic health records via APIs.  They enable patients to access, download, and share health data with other providers and applications which promote patient centered care and interoperability. Data integration and aggregation might be another trend of importance because of the multiplicity of systems and data sources that need to be integrated to provide a holistic view of patient information.  By using integration platforms and data aggregation tools data can be more easily harmonized from disparate sources creating a system of better consistency and interoperability.  IoMT, or the Internet of Medical Things, is an interesting trend because of its reference to medical devices and sensors connected to healthcare systems.  Interoperability in this space involves integrating data from these devices into EHRs and clinical workflows.  Standards related to IoMT include IEEE 11073 and Integrating the Health Enterprise(IHE).  Clinical Decision Support Systems are important to providers in that interoperability integrates patient data and provides evidence-based recommendations to providers at the point of care.  Lastly, and maybe most importantly, is the trend or concept of secure data exchange and privacy.  To make sure that patient data is protected during transmission and storage, technologies such as secure messaging protocols, encryption and access controls are utilized.  Being compliant with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR are crucial in maintaining privacy and interoperability.

Interoperability for healthcare technology provides some opportunities and some threats.  An opportunity for interoperability in healthcare technology is improved care coordination, meaning the facilitation of seamless information exchange between healthcare providers so care can be coordinated more effectively. Enhanced patient engagement is another opportunity because patients now become empowered to actively participate in their healthcare.  It gives the patient access to all their relevant information and fosters transparency and facilitates shared decision making between patient and provider which can lead to better patient satisfaction and compliance.  Another opportunity is the ability to gain data driven insights by supporting the aggregation and analysis of large datasets that facilitates population health management, epidemiological research and the identification of trends which leads to evidence-based decision making, improved public health outcomes and medical breakthroughs.

Threats include concerns about data privacy and security, meaning that unauthorized access, data breaches, or improper handling of patient data can result in reputational damage, legal consequences, and compromised patient trust.  Exchange of information between disparate systems introduces challenges related to data integrity and accuracy in that inconsistent data formats, missing or incomplete information, and data mapping errors may impact the quality and reliability of shared  information.  Technical barriers including incompatible data standards, system interfaces, and variations in data capturing practices need to be overcome by making investments in systems that have these barriers and modifying them to become more interoperable.  The inherent resistance to change and adoption, lack of interoperability awareness, and lack of stakeholder buy-in are also large threats.

Cotiviti could explore the value of HIE by discovering which QHINs might be beneficial in speeding up access to medical records in the healthcare space and leveraging which QHINs might have the greatest reach of organizations to connect with, so transmission of, and access to medical records are equally short in time and expansive in reach.  Giving greater access to coordination of benefits in a simple, easy to understand way, could benefit patients and allow them to have more control of the healthcare they are receiving and pinpoint those treatments, payment options, and operations that will give them the best value and opportunity to live the lives they desire to lead.  This could be done by designing dashboards that are geared toward the patient and their journey through the health care system both physically and financially.  The ability to connect to patients through IoMT to determine eligibility of claims made, would be a way to make sure that fraud, waste, and abuse of medical devices, prescriptions, and any other services are kept at a minimum.
